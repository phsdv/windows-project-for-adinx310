# Overview:
___

This is a Windows-based project for the **[ADIN6310](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adin6310.html)/([ADIN3310](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adin3310.html))** 6 and 3-port Industrial Ethernet TSN switch. This is a Managed switch with a wealth of TSN and Redundancy features. In this project, a Windows platform acts as the host to configure the switch. This project can be used to understand the driver APIs for configuration and management of the switch functionality. The project serves as a reference to help users familiarize themselves with the implementation of driver APIs for all the features of the switch, prior to porting the driver to their own host platform.

The project includes multiple use-case examples demonstrating switch configuration on a Windows platform. It showcases the integration and usage of different communication interfaces, including Ethernet (MAC) and SPI (Standard, Dual, and Quad), to configure and interact with the switch.

Additionally, it provides configuration examples for all versions of ADI evaluation board harware, EVAL-ADIN6310EBZ, EVAL-ADIN3310EBZ, and the Field Switch EVAL-ADIN6310T1LEBZ, covering essential switch management functions such as initialization, port configuration, VLAN setup, and advanced TSN features. This ensures a structured and hands-on approach for developers to understand and deploy the switch in real-world applications.


# System Requirements:  
___

Ensure your system meets the following prerequisites:

1. **Operating System**: Windows 10 or later.  
2. **Software**: [e.g., Visual Studio or other dependencies].  
3. **adinx310 Driver Library**  

   - **3.1** Download the driver library package for **ADIN6310/ADIN3310** from the **[Software Resources](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adin6310.html#software-resources)** section on the **[Product Page](https://www.analog.com/en/products/adin6310.html)**. The same driver package is used for ADIN3310 and ADIN6310. 
   - **3.2** Copy the driver files to the `/project/adinx310-driver/` folder. The contents of this folder should look like this:  
     - `ses-proxy-srv`  
     - `ses-route-srv`  
     - `ses-tsn-api-srv`  
     - `ses-windows-port-srv`  
     - `smp-stk`  
     - `tsn-model-srv`  

4. **External Libraries (Third-party libraries)**  

   - **winpcap/npcap**:  
     - **4.1** Get the **winpcap** library and place it in the `/project/lib/winpcap/` folder. (Tested with version 4.1.3).  
     - **4.2** Download it from [http://www.win10pcap.org/download/](http://www.win10pcap.org/download/).  
     - **4.3** Alternatively, clone **winpcap** from the source:  
       ```sh
       git clone https://github.com/SoftEtherVPN/Win10Pcap
       ```
     - **4.4** `npcap` needs to be installed. You can install it through **Wireshark**. When installing NPCAP, ensure that the **Install Npcap in WinPcap
API-compatible Mode** check box is selected. 

   - **ft42xx/libFT4222**:  [ Required if using SPI interface only ]

     The following dependencies must be resolved to ensure proper functionality when using the **SPI interface**. This Windows project uses the [UMFT4222EV](https://ftdichip.com/products/umft4222ev/) as an SPI dongle which can be plugged directly into the EVAL-ADIN6310EBZ or EVAL-ADIN6310T1LEBZ versions of board.

     - **4.5** Download the latest available **CDM drivers** from [FTDI D2XX Drivers](https://ftdichip.com/drivers/d2xx-drivers/) and unzip them.  
     - **4.6** Connect the device to a spare USB port on your PC. If the device is based on an **FT2232** chip, the Microsoft composite device driver is automatically loaded first.  
     - **4.7** Go to the **D2XX Driver** website, download the driver (.exe file), and install it.  
     - **4.8** Copy the `ftd2xx.dll` file to the `/project/lib/ftd2xx/` directory.


## Build Configurations  

The project can be built in the following two configurations:  

1. **Switch_Ethernet**  
   - In this configuration, SPI-related dependencies (`ft42xx/libFT4222`) are not required.  
   - Only **pcap** dependencies need to be installed.  

2. **Switch_SPI**  
   - This configuration requires all dependencies, including `ft42xx/libFT4222`, to be installed.  
   - It works exclusively with the **FT4222 SPI interface**.  
   - Using a different SPI interface will require modifications in the **porting layer** defined in `SES_PORT_interface.h`.  

## Configuration and Features  

Once the project is successfully built, additional configurations can be adjusted for better functionality and understanding.  

The `SES_configuration.h` file contains various macros that can be used to **enable or disable** specific features. Before starting the configuration, the user must update the **HOST_MAC** macro with the MAC address of the NIC to which the switch is connected.

---

### Configuration Macros  

1. **ENABLE_SPI**  
   - To build the project in **Switch_SPI** mode, this macro must be enabled.  
   - All SPI-related dependencies must be resolved.  
   - The SPI mode (**StandardSPI, DualSPI, or QuadSPI**) can be configured in `SES_example_config.c` inside the `ses_config` function.  
   - By default, the project uses **StandardSPI**.  
   - If SPI is selected as the interface medium, the host strapping must be configured according to the Standard, Dual, or Quad mode specified in the **[Datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/adin3310-6310.pdf)** under the **HOST INTERFACE STRAPPING PINS** section.

2. **SES_PORT_COUNT**  
   - The project supports a **6-port switch (ADIN6310)** and a **3-port switch (ADIN3310)**.  
   - This macro must be set according to the switch used.  
   - The port configuration is available in `SES_example_config.c` for the respective switch.  

3. **SES_PRIMARY_MAC**  
   - This MAC address is assigned to the connected switches internal Packet Assist Engine, additionally each port gets automatically assigned a MAC address based off the primary MAC address.  
   - The Primary MAC is used throughout the session for communication with the switch when using an Ethernet host. The per port MAC addresses are used for the various per-port protocols such as **LLDP, PTP, MSTP, HSR, and PRP** 

4. **HOST_MAC**  
   - Contains the **host MAC address**.  
   - This must be configured as the user's network adapter MAC address.  
   - The MAC address can be obtained from the command prompt using `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig`/`ip a` (Linux).  

5. **DEFAULT_SWITCH**  
   - The switch initializes with the default configuration, enabling **LLDP, PTP, and MSTP**.  
   - To enable other features, set this macro to `false`.  

6. **EVENT**  
   - The switch supports multiple events that can be subscribed to by the host.  
   - When a subscribed event occurs, the switch triggers a callback function to notify the host.  
   - A detailed list of events can be found in `SES_event.h`.  
   - Possible values:  
     - `0`: Disabled  
     - `1`: Enable Link Event Example  
     - `2`: Enable LLDP Event Example

10. **IGMP_SNOOPING**  
    - If set to `1`, enables IGMP snooping.  
    - Also prints **GroupMemberTimeout** and **RouterTimeout**.  

11. **REDUNDANCY_TYPE**

      - `0`: HSR  
      - `1`: HSR REDBOX  
      - `2`: PRP  
      - `3`: PRP REDBOX

      - **Port 1** → PORT A  
      - **Port 2** → PORT B  
      - **Port C** → Host port  
    - If using **SPI**, **Port C is not available**.
